Course Description
This course is primarily designed for undergraduate, especially from Diploma to Bachelors Level students interested in Introductory Course for Computer Science as used in Data Science/Machine Learning Application. The goal of this class is to provide an introduction to key two strands of mathematics: Probability and Linear Algebra, with an emphasis on practical implementation. I will provide a set of lecture slides and notes (These will largely be made and presented in Jupyter Notebooks). There are additional background textbooks that are largely optional.

More generally, this is a course where I emphasise on providing key introductory concepts and analysis. The Course introduces basic mathematical tools and methods needed for computer science.
Elementary mathematical skills for defining, analysing and reasoning with abstract objects used in programming are developed. Topics include integers and rational numbers, strings and sets, algorithms and functions, and elementary introductions to probability This course focuses on laying theoretical foundations of mathematics which are further developed and applied in Introduction to python programming, machine learning, Data Science and more advanced courses on algorithms in later courses.

The Key topics to cover include: 
(i) Review of Sets and Number Theory, 
(ii) Introduction to probability, 
(iii) Introduction to Linear Algebra and
(iv) All the above topics applied to python code and examples

This is a course also, very much focused on writing and producing machine readable code for early learners in computer science . By the end of the term, my hope is for three things:

The Course aims to familize students to core foundational mathematcis from a more practical and hands-on experience Python. The Course will make use of Jupyter notebooks for learning and teaching thoughout the course.
 To introduce students to jupyter notebooks for learning and coding sharing
 To introduce students to foundational mathematics for computer science

There will be problem sets every week. These will involve both theoretical calculations and computer exercises in which you will be asked to write small blocks of code to complete tasks in Probability and Linear Algebra. All these will be worked in Jupyter Notebook. 

You can work together on the problem sets and discuss them with classmates, but you need to write up the results individually and hand them in separately. Grades will be based on the problem sets, divided evenly over the problem sets.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
 Use and apply counting and probability techniques. Students should be comfortable with basic ideas in probability and counting, and applying them in easy real-life settings (for example, counting arrangements of items, computing expectation of a discrete random variable - with an explicit and implicit application to computer science using Jupyter notebooks).

 Communicate mathematically. Students should be able to read and interpret basic mathematical symbols and notation (for example, standard terminology of numbers,
sets, functions, strings, trees and graphs), and be capable of translating and communicating their own ideas into mathematical language.

 Linear algebra notation understanding and be able to complete matrix computations (be able to complete matrix addition, multiplication, subtraction).
